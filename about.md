# Overview

Sartell CoderDojo is a free admission volunteer run youth (ages 7-17) programming club. Club members, referred to as
**Ninjas**, come to learn about programming. Ninjas can work in groups or individually. Starter projects and other
resources are available for Ninjas on arrival. Additionally, mentors are there to help get started and assist with
troubleshooting when things aren't working.

## What Goes on?

Each session lasts two hours and follows the following format:

* **Welcome and Introductions (5 minutes)**: Introduce mentors and Ninjas and discuss expectations.
* **Icebreakers (5-15 minutes)**: To both introduce new Ninjas to other Dojo attendees and to create opportunities for
  Ninjas to interact with one another, we will run icebreaker activities whenever several new Ninjas join a session,
  and every so often even with established Ninjas.
* **Make something cool with code (90 minutes)**: Ninjas work with the support of mentors to produce something with
  code. This can be a project from the [CoderDojo resources site](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo), an online coding tutorial, or it can be something the
  Ninjas, with guidance from their mentors, have imagined and now want to create.

  Ninjas can work together in groups or alone, depending on the nature of their project and their preferences. They
  are encouraged to keep in mind CoderDojo's principle of "Ask three, then me" and to help each other solve problems.

* **Showcase your work (10-20 minutes)**: If they wish, Ninjas can take the opportunity to demonstrate what they built.
* **Wrap up (5 minutes)**: This is when we thank everyone for coming and make any announcements regarding future
  sessions

* A laptop. Borrow one from somebody if needs be. You will need Admin rights to the laptop (or bring someone with who does)
  because some projects will require software installed before starting coding.
* **A parent! (Very important). If you are 12 or under, your parent must stay with you during the session.**
